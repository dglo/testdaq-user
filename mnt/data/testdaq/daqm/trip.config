# Trip Config File
# this is the config file for the trip (or trip.pl) script. This
# is required to run the script
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# This state file holds information like who is currently on a
# trip and all of the data associated with the trip.
# This is required for the program to run, and this file should
# not be changed manually. 
# ex. statefile = '/home/vbittorf/tmp/trip.state'
statefile = /mnt/data/testdaq/daqm/trip.state

# The log file is a programmatic log file; meaning it will log
# script related information [such as errors, warnings,
# and debug information].
# ex. logfile = /home/vbittorf/tmp/trip.log
logfile = /mnt/data/testdaq/daqm/trip.log

# The trip log file is a complete log of trip activity.
# This is the log file to go to if you need information
# about previous trips, current trip activity (such as
# when people are emailed, paged, etc).
# ex. triplogfile = /home/vbittorf/tmp/triplog
# NOTE: You will need to make sure it exists,
# so make sure to mkdir!
tripdir = /mnt/data/testdaq/daqm/triplog

# This is the pager file. This file is read to determine pager
# emails and who is on-shift/off-shift. This MUST be the file
# associated with the paging system (pager.pl).
# Typically, in the paging system, the file will be called:
# pagers.info
# The file is moditified by the paging system as people
# respond/swap pagers. 
# ex. pagersfile = /home/vbittorf/tmp/pagers.info
pagersinfo = /mnt/data/testdaq/daqm/pagers.info

# The pager file. This is the file that will be picked up by
# the pager system to send pages. This MUST contain the word
# trip.
# Note: You must set up the pager system to look for this file
# to do this, find pager.config.
# in pager.config, add this line AFTER the WATCH_FILES line.
# hostname /home/victor/tmp/trip.page
# Where hostname is the name of the machine that the file is on,
# and the path is the SAME as the one below, in this case,
# this config line out be:
# ex. pagefile = /home/victor/tmp/trip.page
pagefile = /mnt/data/testdaq/trip.page

# This is amount of time (in minutes) before the trip is
# over that the traveler will be sent a warning email
# saying their trip is about to end.
# This MUST BE LESS THAN mindur or the behavior of this
# system will be indeterminate. [not error checked]
# Note: this is in minutes!
# ex. warntime = 15
warntime = 15

# The freqency at which to page 
pageperiod = 15

# The amount of time (in minutes) between consecutive emails
# to everyone on broadcastEmails once a person is late.
# If someone is late, an email will be sent to broadcastEmails 
# every emailperiod minutes until the trip is moditified or ended.
# Note: this is in minutes!
# ex. emailperiod = 15
emailperiod = 15

# This minimum duration a trip can be, in minutes.
# The system will not allow people to take trips shorter than
# mindur minutes.
# NOTE: mindur MUST BE GREATER THAN warntime
# ex. mindur = 20
mindur = 20

# The maximum druation a trip can last, in minutes.
# If a user attempts to start a trip longer than this,
# they will be told "no."
# Obvious, this must be greater than mindur.
# ex. maxdur = 3600
# this is MINUTES
maxdur = 3600

# This is the emails of the respondents, admins, and personel
# involved in the trip system. This list of emails will receive
# more detailed information about the system and events.
# This is typically a sub-set of broadcastEmails, though not
# necessarily.
# The format for this field is important!
# Here are examples;
# respondEmails = run_coordination@icecube.wisc.edu
# respondEmails = krasberg@icecube.wisc.edu,vbittorf@icecube.wisc.edu
# respondEmails = spo-icecubewo@usap.gov,vbittorf@icecube.wisc.edu
# The Important format is:
# comma seperation, no white space.
# This must be the same format used for the unix 'mail' command. 
#respondEmails = krasberg@icecube.wisc.edu
respondEmails = spo-icecubewo@usap.gov


# An email will be sent here once a user is late. This should be
# a large list of people. This follows the same format as respondEmails.
# An email will be sent to this list every emailperiod once someone is
# late and once a late running trip has ended. 
# ex. [see respondEmails]
#broadcastEmails = verhager@usap.gov,pariseca@usap.gov,krasberg@icecube.wisc.edu,bitfort@gmail.com
broadcastEmails = spo-icecubewo@usap.gov
