DOMHub testdaq user utility scripts

This project is a gradual attempt to archive and clean up the ~testdaq
directories on the IceCube DOMHubs.  A number of utility scripts
(e.g. status, quickstatus, pUp, pCycle, pDown, etc.) are still in regular
use, and these are in this SVN repository.  

A small number of files are not in SVN, including some testing .jar files.
These files are archived and are available via rsync:

rsync code.icecube.wisc.edu::Offline/infrastructure-source/testdaq-misc-13.0.tar.gz .

To build a testdaq RPM for installation on the DOMHubs, first check this
project out.  Then rsync the misc tarball above, and unpack it from this
directory.  Then, "make rpm".
